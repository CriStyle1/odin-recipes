        <p>Borscht is a sour soup that is traditionally made with meat stock and boiled vegetables. The Ukrainian version, which features beets, is perhaps the most well known type — but varieties of borscht can be found throughout Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>Vegetable oil: Cook the onion in oil. </li>

            <li>Garlic: Three cloves of garlic add bold flavor. </li>
            <li>Sugar: A teaspoon of white sugar lends subtle sweetness. </li>
